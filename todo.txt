##### Main script #####----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#IMPORTANT, pacman.conf is still broken meaning that sed is not working as intended, at this point maybe it would be just easyer to have a pacman.conf in the repo and move it in place

#IMPORTANT Make the script interactive, so it will ask if you want
#IMPORTANT Split scritps with interactive prompts so as to make it also usable on other machines
#IMPORTANT Split scripts into smaller elements so as to be able to quickly apply single configurations
#IMPORTANT Split pkglist.txt into various files based on a category, i.e. games, fonts, multimedia, nvidia, etc...

# Test #

# Make the first script write a systemd unit that starts at login and runs the next part of the script so as to automate that step too

# Cleanup installation files once over

# Move defaults into the anianicy dir

# Write a script that checks differences in local pkglist.txt with the script pkglist.txt

# Test liquorix and see if it works better than default zen

##### Clean up stuff#####--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Try and move nvidia CUDA_CACHE_PATH to /etc/enviroment and swap to dmenu to launch it

# Clean up vimrc

# Also take a look at aconfmgr if needed

# Solve the .pulse-cookie issue caused by steam once and for all, currently using /etc/pulse/client.conf to point steam to $XDG_HOME_CONFIG/pulse/cookie but this seems to drastic of a solution

# Expand the list of cleanup services to include more functions, like removing unwanted clutter in the home and config directory
    # Write a systemcd unit that cleans the .cache folder (is this safe?)
    # Write a systemd unit that cleans the .config directory; Should look into aconfmgr to see how to make this feasible


##### Laptop server #####--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Take out the hdd from my laptop and hook it up to my desktop, salvage what is needed and wipe it clean.

# Use an usb to install debian using ssh

# Setup an mpd satellite server

# Maybe buy a small screen and fuse it to a vga port to easily access laptops with broken monitors

# Learn how to properly setup firejail and apparmor to secure the server

##### maim #####-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Write some cool scripts

# See how to use dmenu to take user input and parse it as a filename


##### Misc #####-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# See if I can implement trash-cli into a gui instead of having to use gvfs

# Write python script to remove duplicates from playlist (tfg)

# Look into disk encryption and secureboot for laptop

# Write a script that automatically fetches the newest art from a list of twitter artists using gallery-dl
